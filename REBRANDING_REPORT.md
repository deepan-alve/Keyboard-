# AzhagiKeys Rebranding Report

## Completed Tasks

### Configuration Files Updated
- `settings.gradle.kts`: Changed project name to "AzhagiKeys"
- `app/build.gradle.kts`: Changed namespace to "com.azhagi.azhagikeys" and updated copyright
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: Updated all package references to com.azhagi.azhagikeys
- `app/src/main/res/xml/method.xml`: Updated to use the new app name
- `app/src/main/res/xml/spellchecker.xml`: Updated to use the new app name
- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`: Added azhagi_app_name

### Code Structure Updated
- Created new package directories for the app: com/azhagi/azhagikeys in main, test, and androidTest
- Copied and transformed all Kotlin source files from dev.patrickgold.florisboard to com.azhagi.azhagikeys
- Updated all import statements and package declarations
- Updated references to the old package name within the code

### Other Updates

- Created new database schema directories for AzhagiKeys

## Pending Tasks

### Library Files
- Update any remaining references to the old package in library files

### Icons and Assets
- Replace app icon and other assets with new AzhagiKeys branding (to be done later)

### Testing
- Test building the app with the new package structure
- Verify all functionality works correctly
- Check for any remaining references to "FlorisBoard" or "floris" that may have been missed

### App Store
- Update app store listings and promotional materials

## Next Steps

1. Run a build to verify everything works correctly
2. Test the app on a device to ensure functionality
3. Design and implement new icons and branding assets
4. Clean up any unnecessary files from the old package structure
5. Update documentation with the new branding

## Notes

The rebranding process has been mostly automated using PowerShell scripts to ensure consistency across the codebase. The app should maintain full functionality while sporting the new AzhagiKeys brand identity.
